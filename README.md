#### Code Design:

Purpose: Involves planning the structure, architecture, and components of the software before actual coding begins.

Focus: Design focuses on how different parts of the system will interact, data flow, algorithms, and the overall architecture.

Outcome: Results in design documents, diagrams, and specifications that guide the development process.

Tools/Activities: Use of UML diagrams, flowcharts, design patterns, and architectural blueprints.

#
#### Code Development:

Purpose: Involves writing, testing, and refining the actual code based on the design specifications.

Focus: Development is concerned with implementing the design in a programming language, debugging, and ensuring functionality.

Outcome: Results in working software, which is tested and iterated upon.

Tools/Activities: Use of IDEs, version control systems, coding, unit testing, and code reviews.
